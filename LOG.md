# Project Log

A log for the Garage Door Man project, started a little late (8/5/2021).

## August 4th, 2021

Tried to get the sensor working on the board, software appears to be working, but the numbers from the sensor do not make any sense.
I tried trouble shooting the connections on the breadboard with no luck.

## August 5th, 2021

I soldered the ADC and the sensor itself to some header pins and put those in the breadboard. Right away the distances were more reasonable.

I then put the board in the garage as is to test out the sensor's ability to detect the garage door.

Oddly enough the sensor is returning a consistent distance when the garage door is closed that is larger than the distance reported when the 
garage door is open.
